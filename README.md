# Expo CLI: Uncommon Errors from Unsupported Features or SDK Mismatches

This repository demonstrates an example of uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI, specifically those stemming from unsupported features or incompatibility with the current Expo SDK version.  These errors often produce unhelpful error messages.  The example shows a scenario and a solution.

## Reproduction

The `expoBug.js` file contains code attempting to use a hypothetical feature not supported by the current Expo SDK version.  This will trigger a build failure or runtime error, highlighting the problem. 

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` demonstrates how to resolve the problem, either by upgrading the Expo SDK to support the needed feature, using an alternative approach that is supported, or by replacing the unsupported feature with a compatible one.

## Additional Notes

Debugging these types of errors often requires carefully examining the Expo CLI logs and potentially investigating related documentation or community forums for similar issues.  Checking for SDK updates is also a crucial step.
