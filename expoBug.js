This error occurs when you try to use a feature or library that is not supported by the Expo CLI or your current Expo SDK version. For example, if you try to use a native module that hasn't been properly configured for Expo, or if you use a feature from a newer Expo SDK version than the one you have installed.  This often results in cryptic error messages that are difficult to diagnose.  The error might manifest as a build failure or a runtime exception.
