The solution to this type of error depends on the specific unsupported feature or SDK version mismatch. 

**1. Upgrade Expo SDK:** The simplest fix is to update your Expo SDK version to a newer one that supports the desired feature. You can do this using:
```bash
expo upgrade
```

**2. Use Supported Alternatives:** If upgrading isn't feasible, find a supported alternative to the unsupported feature.  For instance, if you're using a native module that's unsupported, search for a compatible alternative that works with Expo.

**3. Replace Unsupported Feature:** If neither of the previous options are viable, rewrite the code to avoid the unsupported feature completely.   Use a more fundamental approach that works within the constraints of your current Expo SDK version.

**Example (Illustrative):**
Let's assume the unsupported feature is `expo-unsupported-module`. The `expoBug.js` will cause an error while the `expoBugSolution.js` will solve it.

```javascript
// expoBug.js (Illustrative)
import unsupportedModule from 'expo-unsupported-module'; 

const App = () => {
  unsupportedModule.doSomething(); 
  return (
    <View></View>
  );
};
```

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js (Illustrative)
// Replacing the unsupported module with an alternative
const App = () => {
  //Use an alternative approach that avoids the unsupported module
  return (
    <View></View>
  );
};
```
